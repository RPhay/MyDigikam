# About

digiKam is an advanced open-source digital photo management application that runs on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
The application provides a comprehensive set of tools for importing, managing, editing, and sharing photos and RAW files.

![Albums View and Image Editor](/project/img/README/35354951072.webp)

You can use digiKam's import capabilities to easily transfer photos, RAW files, and videos directly from your camera
and external storage devices (SD cards, USB disks, etc.). The application allows you to configure import settings
and rules that process and organize imported items on-the-fly.

![Map View displaying rated items and Batch Queue Manager in action](/project/img/README/32558229094.webp)

digiKam organizes photos, RAW files, and videos into albums. But the application also features powerful tagging
tools that allow you to assign tags, ratings, and labels to photos and raw files. You can then use filtering
functionality to quickly find items that match specific criteria.

In addition to filtering functionality, digiKam features powerful searching capabilities that let you search
the photo library by a wide range of criteria. You can search photos by tags, labels, rating, data, location,
and even specific EXIF, IPTC, or XMP metadata.

![Search by Tags with preview mode and Metadata Editor in action](/project/img/README/32217007615.webp)

You can also combine several criteria for more advanced searches. digiKam rely on Exiv2 library to handle metadata
tag contents from files to populate the photo library.

digiKam can handle RAW files, and the application uses the excellent LibRaw library for decoding raw files.
The library is actively maintained and regularly updated to include support for the latest camera models.

![Find by items similarity and Light Table in action to compare side by side](/project/img/README/31407487553.webp)

The application provides a comprehensive set of editing tools. This includes basic tools for adjusting colors,
cropping, and sharpening as well as advanced tools for, curves adjustment, panorama stitching, and much more.
A special tool based on Lensfun library permit to apply lens corrections automatically on images.
