 * Description : main program from digiKam (stub for Windows binary)
 *               The main implementation is built into a DLL to be called by a stub EXE.
 *               This is a work around "command line is too long" issue on Windows.
 *               see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43184251/cmake-command-line-too-long-windows
